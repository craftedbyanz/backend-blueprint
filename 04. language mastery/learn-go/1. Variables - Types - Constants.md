# Declaring a single variable

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var age int // variable declaration
	fmt.Println("My age is", age)
}
```

# Declaring a variable with an initial value

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var age int = 29 // variable declaration with initial value

	fmt.Println("My age is", age)
}
```

# Type inference

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var age = 29 // type will be inferred
	fmt.Println("My age is", age)
}
```

# Multiple variable declaration

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var width, height int = 100, 50 //declaring multiple variables

	fmt.Println("width is", width, "height is", height)
}
```

# Short hand declaration

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	count := 10
	fmt.Println("Count =",count)
}
```

# Type

1. bool
2. Signed integers

   ```
   int8: represents 8 bit signed integers
   size: 8 bits
   range: -128 to 127

   int16: represents 16 bit signed integers
   size: 16 bits
   range: -32768 to 32767

   int32: represents 32 bit signed integers
   size: 32 bits
   range: -2147483648 to 2147483647

   int64: represents 64 bit signed integers
   size: 64 bits
   range: -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807

   int: represents 32 or 64 bit integers depending on the underlying platform. You should generally be using int to represent integers unless there is a need to use a specific sized integer.
   size: 32 bits in 32 bit systems and 64 bit in 64 bit systems.
   range: -2147483648 to 2147483647 in 32 bit systems and -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807 in 64 bit systems
   ```

3. Unsigned integers

   ```
   uint8: represents 8 bit unsigned integers
   size: 8 bits
   range: 0 to 255

   uint16: represents 16 bit unsigned integers
   size: 16 bits
   range: 0 to 65535

   uint32: represents 32 bit unsigned integers
   size: 32 bits
   range: 0 to 4294967295

   uint64: represents 64 bit unsigned integers
   size: 64 bits
   range: 0 to 18446744073709551615

   uint : represents 32 or 64 bit unsigned integers depending on the underlying platform.
   size : 32 bits in 32 bit systems and 64 bits in 64 bit systems.
   range : 0 to 4294967295 in 32 bit systems and 0 to 18446744073709551615 in 64 bit systems
   ```

4. Floating point types

   - float32: 32 bit floating point numbers
   - float64: 64 bit floating point numbers

5. Complex types
6. Other numeric types

   - byte is an alias of uint8
   - `rune` is an alias of int32

7. string type

# Type Conversion

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    i := 10
    var j float64 = float64(i) //this statement will not work without explicit conversion
    fmt.Println("j", j)
}
```

# Constants

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	const a = 50
	fmt.Println(a)
}
```

# Declaring a group of constants

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	const (
		name = "John"
		age = 50
		country = "Canada"
	)
	fmt.Println(name)
	fmt.Println(age)
	fmt.Println(country)
}
```
